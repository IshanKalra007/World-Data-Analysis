# World-Data-Analysis

The data
The data for this project is a slightly modified version of the Kaggle Global Country
Information Dataset 2023 ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-
world-2023 ), which provides global data at country level on, e.g., demographic statistics, economic
indicators, environmental factors, health metrics, educational statistics, etc.
The dataset contains measures for 195 countries, across 36 attributes and indicators. The first three
attributes include country identifiers (Country name, country id, and the 2-letter county abbreviation),
which is followed by Latitude and Longitude data for the country. The remaining 31 attributes contain
data on a range of factors and indicators.
